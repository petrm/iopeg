IoPEG is a [PEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (Parsing Expression Grammar) parser generator, written in [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/). It comes with a parser for the (simple) Io grammar itself, as well as the ability to create additional grammars that are parsed by Io.

Many features of IoPEG are inspired by the [Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) PEG-based language.
