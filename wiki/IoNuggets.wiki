{{{
foo := method( call activated call )
}}}
// Boom. I was trying for a strange infinite loop, and found a strange crash.
----
{{{
foo := method( call message protos first slotNames )
}}}
// Hmmmmmmm. This is cool. Some "unnamed" proto of Call objects has cool stuffs.
----
{{{
Directory with( launchPath ) items foreach(i,v,v name println)
}}}
// I'm a bit wary of 'stringing' so many calls together. But maybe that fear is invalid in Io.

This made me laugh, and smile:
"In case you were wondering, method is a method on Object that creates anonymous methods."

Random things that can be done with the regex library:
{{{
Io> s := "one!two!!three!!!"
==> one!two!!three!!!
Io> s splitAtRegex("!+")
==> list("one", "two", "three", "")
Io> s := "37signals"
==> 37signals
Io> s hasMatchOfRegex("signals")
==> true
Io> "one two three" allMatchesOfRegex("\\w+") map(asString println)
one
two
three
==> list("one", "two", "three")
}}}
