#summary Notes about Io from a beginner
#labels Io

Here are some things about Io that surprised me as I came to learn it. As background, I have experience in JavaScript, Lua, and Ruby.
----
t1 := Date now
t2 := Date now
# oops; t1 just got mutated
# must use Date clone now
----
Bad docs for Number asString
---- 
Number asString, first param oddly named
----
Where's sprintf? Any convenient way of formatting numbers as strings?
----
Why is Protos Addons not the same as Protos protos last?
----
The 'magic' updateSlot that operates on self and the 'magic' forward that forwards messages to self conflicts mentally with no 'magic' setSlot.
----
thisLocalContext slotNames contains( "forward" ) == false
thisLocalContext protos isEmpty == true
... so how does it forward messages to self?
//Steve Dekorte says that there's an optimization that hard-looks in Locals instead of via protos.//  
----
Frustrating no-documentation methods. Not just no examples, but not even a summary description.
----
The word 'context' is confusing. Why not just 'object'?
----
There is Sequence endsWithSeq, where is startsWithSeq?
----
In Ruby, Array#empty? tests if it's empty. A few times I've done List empty and been weirded out when it never returns false.
